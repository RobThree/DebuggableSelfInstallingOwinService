# Debuggable, Self-Installing, Self-Hosted OWin Windows Service
A Debuggable, Self-Installing, Self-Hosted OWin Windows Service Template based on [James Michael Hare](http://geekswithblogs.net/BlackRabbitCoder)'s excellent blogposts:

## How to use ##

* Download [the Visual Studio template](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/02226e0f-9056-403b-b94d-298f9cc06b0f)
* Create a new project and select / search for `DebuggableOwinService` (see screenshot below)
* Restore the required NuGet packages (a README will be shown with (short) instructions)
* Implement any of the provided `OnStart()`, `OnStop()`, `OnPause()`, `OnContinue()`, `OnShutDown()` and `OnCustomCommand()` methods
* Modify the `App.Config` for the correct hostname/port information
* Run/debug your application as usual, continue your development cycle as always
* When your application is done, open a console (with Administrative privileges!) and execute `MyApp.exe -install`to install your service; now you can start/stop/pause your service. To uninstall your service simply run `MyApp.exe -uninstall`.

## More ##

The `WindowsService.cs` file contains the `ServiceImplementation` class which, as it's name suggests, implements all service methods. This class has been fitted with an `WindowsServiceAttribute` which you can use to control some service-specific properties like `Name`, `DisplayName`, `Description`, `UserName`, `Password`, `EventLogSource`, `StartMode`, `CanPauseAndContinue`, `CanShutdown`, `CanStop` and services your service depends on via `ServiceDependsOn`.

## But I want more! ##

Sure! No problem. I can recommend the excellent [Topshelf](http://topshelf-project.com/) project, also available as [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Topshelf/). This allows for even more control, has [way better documentation](https://topshelf.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) and is [also available on GitHub](https://github.com/Topshelf/Topshelf)!
